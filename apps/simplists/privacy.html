            <h3>Your Data is Private</h3>

            <p>The Snaplists app does not collect any user information. There is no sign-up, sign-in, or opportunity in the app to give us your personal information.  The app uses Appleâ€™s iCloud service to sync your lists across your devices.

            <h3>In-App Feedback</h3>

            <p>The app does provide a feedback feature to allow you to provide us feedback about the app. This feature opens a simple email to us. Be aware that by sending the email, you are giving us your email address. We do not use this email address for anything other than responding to your feedback, via email.  If you prefer, you can tweet us at @snaplistsapp.</p>

            <h3>No External Services</h3>

            <p>The Snaplists app does not use any 3rd party/external services.  There are no analytics gathering, behavior tracking, etc.  This app uses only Apple-provided APIs and frameworks.</p>

            <h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
